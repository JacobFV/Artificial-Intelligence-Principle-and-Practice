# Artificial Intelligence: Principle and Practice

**Free 8-day workshop bringing you to the cutting-edge  of artificial intelligence theory and technique!**

This completely free workshop is intended to give undergraduate and graduate students from all science and engineering majors a fast introduction to the modern artificial intelligence theory and technique with special emphasis on machine learning. 

It will be held in 80-minute online sessions twice a week over 8 days of October. To accomadate varied schedules,    sessions will be held on:

- Mondays and Wednesdays (12:30 - 1:50pm)
- Tuesdays and Thursdays (12:30 - 1:50pm)

We will study:

 - 'Classical' AI shortcomings and modern symbolic progressing techniques </br>
 - Machine learning fundamentals, neural networks, and deep learning </br>
 - Computer vision, sequence modeling, natural language processing, deep graph processing </br>
 - Reinforcement learning, multi-agent RL, self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and domain generalization </br>
 - MLops, AI safety, and ethics </br>

We will use:

 - Python </br>
 - `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` </br>
 - `TensorFlow`, `Keras`,  `transformers` </br>
 - OpenAI `gym`, `PettingZoo`, `ThreeDWorld` </br>
 - `tensorboard`, `wandb`, docker, and the Google Cloud Platform </br>

Before signing up, you should already be able to calculate basic derivatives, apply probability & statistics to toy problems, and write simple Python programs. 

If your neurons have accumulated sufficient presynaptic evidence and your reward estimator feels like it's ready to explode, please [join](https://jacobfv.github.io/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice/#signup) this exciting workshop!

ps: (Much of this document was drafted by a language generation model.)
