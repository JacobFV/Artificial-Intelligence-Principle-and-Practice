This two-section, month-long class will fill a vital need in the education offered at UTA. I would like to offer this class starting this fall semester. But I need your help getting:
- additional students to sign up for the class
- a place to host the class 
- GCP/AWS/Azure/etc. compute resources for the class
- a temporary class license for the OpenAI API
- robots to test our code on

Thank you everyone for your help!

NOTE: This course plan is presented in good faith, but details are still under development and may change.
