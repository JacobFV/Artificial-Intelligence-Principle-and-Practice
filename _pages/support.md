This two-section, month-long class will fill a vital need in the education offered at UTA. I would like to offer this class starting this fall semester. But I need your help getting:

ðŸ”² Students!: Professors, please share [this flyer](https://github.com/JacobFV/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice/raw/main/assets/flyer/ai_course_flyer.pdf) or the link to [this website](https://jacobfv.github.io/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice/) with your students.

ðŸ”² **Lecture hall**: I'm preparing for around 50 students to attend each session (M-Th 12:30-1:50pm).

ðŸ”² **Compute resources**: time on UTA Cluster, UT Cluster, or AWS/GCP/Azure credits.

âœ… ~~**Temporary license** for entire class to use the OpenAI API~~ Thanks OpenAI!

ðŸ”² **Robot equiptment** to build 30 LittleArm V3's and 30 LittleBot's.

ðŸ”² [financial support for all of the above](https://github.com/JacobFV/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice). This entire program is offered free of charge. I am not making any money, and I will save leftover funds for the next workshop.

Thank you everyone for your help!

NOTE: This course plan is presented in good faith, but I'm details are still under development and may change.
