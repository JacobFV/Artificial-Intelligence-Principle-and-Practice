This two-section, month-long class will fill a vital need in the education offered at UTA. I would like to offer this class starting this fall semester. But I need your help getting:
- Students!: Professors, please share [this invitation](TODO) with your students
- Lecture hall: I'd like to prepare for around 50 students to attend each session (M-Th 1:00-3:50pm). 
- Compute resources: time on UTA Cluster, UT Cluster, or AWS/GCP/Azure credits
- Temporary license for entire class to use the OpenAI API
- Robots: articulated arm, [OpenBot](https://www.openbot.org/), and [microMVP swarm](https://arc.cs.rutgers.edu/mvp/) (or similar)
- [financial support for all of the above](https://github.com/JacobFV/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice)

Thank you everyone for your help!

NOTE: This course plan is presented in good faith, but details are still under development and may change.
