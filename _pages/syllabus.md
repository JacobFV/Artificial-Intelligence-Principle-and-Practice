Artificial intelligence -- such as computer vision, natural language processing, and formal logic systems to name a few -- are increasingly playing a central role in every aspect of our lives: [gaming](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/gameGAN/), [robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08617), [engineering](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/chip-design-with-deep-reinforcement.html), [healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325854/), [finance](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-04/artificial_intelligence_in_finance_-_turing_report_0.pdf), and even [governance](https://ai.google/static/documents/perspectives-on-issues-in-ai-governance.pdf) to name a few. Most of this website was drafted [using artificial intelligence](https://copilot.github.com/). It's comparable to the Internet 25 years ago, it's the modern equivalence of high-level programming languages; employers desparately want developers who can harness it; writers constantly talk about it; and we don't even realize how much we're already using it. But just how does artificial intelligence work? 

*Artificial Intelligence: Principle and Practice* is an 8 day workshop that covers the science and engineering of artificial intelligence. It will be divided into a lecture, lab, and "Deep Dive" discussion - each 45 minutes long on both M/W and T/Th. All classes will also be broadcast on YouTube for those who are unable to attend in person. 

The *lecture* is an interactive undergraduate-style lecture designed to cover the core concepts of AI with emphasis on deep learning. "Undergraduate-style" means you are only expected to be able to calculate the derivative of a 'simple' function, apply probability & statistics to toy problems, and write simple Python programs. We are going to peer far beyond mathematical symbols on paper into the intelligent system they define. (In the process of writing, GPT-3 suggested adding: "you will be given a task and asked to explain the algorithm." I may include something along these lines)

The *lab* is developed to give you hands-on experience with real data, real experiments, and real problems. The lab will start by using numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, tensorboard, and openai-gym. Depending on class skill level, the lab may also use: jax, pytorch, huggingface, tf-lite, pettingzoo; TDW, and generic docker deployment. We will also use cloud compute to manage Internet-scale deep learning workflows. By the final week, you will have (individually or in teams) designed and developed your own novel, real world AI system, and the final day will be devoted to student presentations.

The *"Deep Dive"* is a graduate-style paper and peer-focused discussion. "Graduate-stle" means this section will spend much time reviewing and discussing landmark and state-of-the-art papers in AI. You will also have more opportunity to present your own thoughts or contributions on this discipline than in the lecture. 

There will be no homework, no tests, and no costs (this course is free). **This course is not accredited by UTA** However there will be individualized activities, machine learning, and most importantly, human learning.
