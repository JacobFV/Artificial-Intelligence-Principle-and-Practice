Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a central role in every aspect of our lives: [gaming](), [robotics](), [engineering](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/chip-design-with-deep-reinforcement.html), [healthcare](), [finance](), [security](), and [governance](https://ai.google/static/documents/perspectives-on-issues-in-ai-governance.pdf) to name a few. Most of this website was drafted [using artificial intelligence](https://copilot.github.com/). It's comparable to the Internet 25 years ago, it's the modern equivalence of high-level programming languages; employers desparately want developers who can harness it; writers constantly talk about it; and we don't even realize how much we're already using it. But just how does artificial intelligence work? 

This course *Artificial Intelligence: Principle and Practice* is a 1-month long course that covers the theory and practice of artificial intelligence. It will be divided into a lecture and lab - each 45 minutes long on Mondays and Wednesdays 1:00 - 1:50pm and 2:00 - 2:50pm. All classes will also be broadcast on MS Teams for later vieiwing.

The lecture will cover the core concepts of AI with emphasis on deep learning. We are going to peer far beyond mathematical symbols on paper into the intelligent system they define. We will cover a huge spectrum of deep learning approaches, techniques, and perspectives including classical artificial 'intelligence', machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the generalization limits of artificial intelligence.  

The lab section is developed to implement AI concepts in a practical setting. We will get hands-on experience with real data, real experiments, and real learning experience using several deep learning frameworks and tools (scipy and IPython suites, jax, tensorflow, tensorboard, pytorch, huggingface, tf-lite, openai-gym, pettingzoo; TDW, generic docker deployment) to reimplement and improve algorithms from landmark academic papers. We will also use cloud compute to manage Internet-scale deep learning workflows. By the final week, I want to help every one of you (individually or in teams) design and develop your own novel, real world AI system, give a presentation on it, and plan to integrate it into a real world setting.

There will be no homework, no tests, and no grading (besides recommendation letters). **This course is not accredited by UTA** However there will be individualized written assignments, machine learning, and most importantly, human learning. If you're neurons are on the verge of firing and your reward estimator feels like it's ready to explode, please consider taking this course.
