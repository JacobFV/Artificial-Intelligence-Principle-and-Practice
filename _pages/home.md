This completely free workshop is intended to give undergraduate and graduate students from all science and engineering majors a fast introduction to the modern artificial intelligence theory and technique with special emphasis on machine learning. 

It will be held in 80-minute online sessions twice a week over 8 days of October. To accomodate varied schedules, sessions will be held on:

- Mondays and Wednesdays (12:30 - 1:50pm)
- Tuesdays and Thursdays (12:30 - 1:50pm)

We will study:

 - 'Classical' AI shortcomings and modern symbolic progressing techniques
 - Machine learning fundamentals, neural networks, and deep learning
 - Computer vision, generative modeling, sequence modeling, natural language processing, deep graph processing 
 - Reinforcement learning, multi-agent RL, self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and domain generalization
 - MLops, AI safety, and ethics

---

We will use:

 - Python
 - `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
 - `TensorFlow`, `Keras`,  `transformers`
 - OpenAI `gym`, `PettingZoo`, `ThreeDWorld`
 - `tensorboard`, `wandb`, docker, and the Google Cloud Platform
