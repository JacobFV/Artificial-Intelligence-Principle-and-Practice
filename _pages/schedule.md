ðŸš§ Warning: Under construction ðŸš§

Epoch 0. **Initialization**: overview basic concepts of artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, and multi-agent systems as well as AI ethics and ML ops. In **lab** we'll write some basic decision trees to control simulated and real robots and tap into knowledge bases to make a trivia answering system.

Epoch 1. **Machines that Learn**: fundamental concepts of machine learning, including optimization and gradient descent, probablistic modeling and factor graph representation, regression, classification, clustering, regularization, and ensembles. In **lab** we'll parse demographic data and build a shallow machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a user's income.

Epoch 2. **Deep Dive**: basic concepts of deep learning, common architectures, layer types, and activation functions as well as backpropagation, optimization, loss functions, and training paradigms. In **lab**, we'll build a neural network from custom-built layers to solve an image classification problem.

Epoch 3. **The Zoo**: overview of specific deep learning architectures including DNNs, AEs, CNNs, GANs, RNNs, attention-based models, GNNs, and mutlimodal systems. In **lab** we'll do neural network 'surgery' on several popular models and try to improve their performance.

Epoch 4. **Reinforcement Learning**: the classical utility agent, various extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, training setups, and environments, cooperative/competitive/mixed-mode multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, and advantages and pitfalls of RL. In **lab** we'll train a mixed-mode multi-agent reinforcement learning system in various simulated environments.

Epoch 5. **Intelligence**: transfer learning, generalization, zero/one/few-shot learning, distilation, information theory, corellators, criticality, generalization, transferability, the relationship between intelligence and learning, and the limits of AI generality. In **lab** we'll play with large language models including gpt-3 ada, babbage, curie, davinci, davinci-instruct, davinci-codex. We'll also attempt small and large examples of transfer learning all the way to transfering a pretrained language model to perform computer vision tasks.

Epoch 6. **Hello World**: AI safety, security, privacy, federated learning, and ethics, AI in the news, in acedemia, and in the workplace, ML ops, human-AI interaction, environmental impact, and the impact of AI on human life. In **lab** students will put MLops to work on a small self-guided group project of any size. Groups with reasonable metric performance will receive additional compute resource credits. 

Epoch 7. **Project Day!** Students present their projects to the class. Students will also have a chance to connect with and other students to discuss their projects, the course, and AI.
