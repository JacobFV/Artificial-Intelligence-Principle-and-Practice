Day 0. (Wed. Sept. 1st) Initialization: Initialization: overview basic concepts of artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, and multi-agent systems as well as AI ethics and ML ops.

Day 1. (Wed. Sept. 8th) Machines that learn: fundamental concepts of machine learning, including optimization and gradient descent, probablistic modeling and factor graph representation, regression, classification, clustering, regularization, and ensembles.

Day 2. (Mon. Sept. 13th) Deep dive: basic concepts of deep learning, common architectures, layer types, and activation functions as well as backpropagation, optimization, loss functions, and training paradigms.

Day 3. (Wed. Sept. 15th) The Zoo: overview of specific deep learning architectures including DNNs, AEs, CNNs, GANs, RNNs, attention-based models, GNNs, and mutlimodal systems.

Day 4. (Mon. Sept. 20th) Reinforcement learning: the classical utility agent, various extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, training setups, and environments, cooperative/competitive/mixed-mode multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, and advantages and pitfalls of RL.

Day 5. (Wed. Sept. 22th) Intelligence: transfer learning, generalization, zero/one/few-shot learning, distilation, information theory, corellators, criticality, generalization, transferability, the relationship between intelligence and learning, and the limits of AI generality.

Day 6. (Mon. Sept. 27th) Hello World: AI safety, security, privacy, federated learning, and ethics, AI in the news, in acedemia, and in the workplace, ML ops, human-AI interaction, environmental impact, and the impact of AI on human life.
