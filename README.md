# Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice
Deep-learning focused introduction to AI from theory to code

<div id="introduction"></div>
Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a central role in every aspect of our lives: recommendation, navigation, healthcare, finance, engineering, gaming, and robotics, to name a few. Most of this course document was drafted using artificial intelligence. It's booming to life like the Internet was 25 years ago, it's the modern equivalence of high-level programming languages, the secret sauce of software enginering, and the subject of close attention by research, industry, and ethics communities. The emergence of human-level artificial intelligence systems (which is presently taking place in a variety of fields) is an exciting opportunity for students and researchers to explore the theory, practice, and impact of this technology.

This course *Artificial Intelligence: Principle and Practice* is a 1-month long dual lecture-lab course that covers the theory and practice of artificial intelligence. It will be divided into a theoretical and a technical section - each 1 hour long. There will be two labs and two lectures each week with time and dates determined by student availability and course logistics. All classes will also be broadcast on MS Teams for later vieiwing.

The theoretical section will cover the core concepts of AI with emphasis on deep learning. We are going to peer far beyond mathematical symbols on paper into the intelligent system they define. We will cover a huge spectrum of deep learning approaches, techniques, and perspectives including classical artificial 'intelligence', machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the generalization limits of artificial intelligence.  

The technical section will cover the implementation of these concepts in a practical setting. We will get hands-on experience with real data, real experiments, and real learning experience using several deep learning frameworks and tools (scipy and IPython suites, tensorflow, tensorboard, pytorch, huggingface, tf-lite, openai-gym, pettingzoo; TDW, generic docker deployment) to reimplement and improve algorithms from landmark academic papers. We will also use cloud compute to manage Internet-scale deep learning workflows. By the final week, I want to help every one of you (individually or in teams) design and develop your own novel, real world AI system, give a presentation on it, and plan to integrate it into a real world setting. 

There will be no homework, no tests, and no grading (besides recommendation letters). **This course is not accredited by UTA** However there will be individualized written assignments, machine learning, and most importantly, human learning. If you're neurons are on the verge of firing and your reward estimator feels like it's ready to explode, please [consider taking this course](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqPcZgCvDzUOFr8F5pFq8eCSVV-cvPlz2KmHe8YnA7wOmdCg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Course Expectations
<div id="course-expectations"></div>

Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge on artificial intelligence. Students who come to this course should already:
- be comfortable with the basic syntax and language features of Python and
- understand algebra, probability, elementary calculus, and simple vector and matrix operations.

If many in the class already have a strong background in these fields, we will accelerate the course as appropriate. If you do not feel like you understand the above topics or you have never used a programming language, please [contact me](#contact) and I can help you get started.

There will be **no required homework** for any portion of this course. Most lectures will include a brief written exam.

## Course Cirriculum
<div id="course-cirriculum"></div>

The course is designed to introduce students to the theory and practice of artificial intelligence with biased emphasis on deep learning. We will (try to) cover the following topics:

0. Initialization: overview basic concepts of artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, and multi-agent systems.
1. Machines that learn: fundamental concepts of machine learning, including regression, classification, clustering, regularization, and ensembles as well as basic information theory.
2. Deep dive: basic concepts of deep learning, common architectures, layer types, and activation functions as well as backpropagation, optimization, loss functions, and training paradigms.
3. The Zoo: overview of specific deep learning architectures including DNNs, VAEs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, attention-based models, GNNs, and mutlimodal systems.
4. Reinforcement learning: the classical utility agent, various extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, training setups, and environments, cooperative/competitive/mixed-mode multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, and advantages and pitfalls of RL.
5. Intelligence: generalization, zero/one/few-shot learning, transfer learning, more information theory, criticality, generalization, transferability, the relationship between intelligence and learning, and the limits of AI generality.

This cirriculumn does not designate particular units for ethics, independant study technique, or the natural inspirations of artificial intelligence because they will be interwoven throughout the course discussion.

## Get Involved
<div id="get-involved"></div>

This two-section, month-long class will fill a vital need in the education offered at UTA. I would like to offer this class starting this fall semester. But I need your help getting:
- additional students to sign up for the class
- a place to host the class 
- GCP/AWS/Azure/etc. compute resources for the class
- a temporary class license for the OpenAI API
- robots to test our code on

Thank you everyone for your help!
