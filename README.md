# Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice
Deep-learning focused introduction to AI from theory to code

<div id="introduction"></div>
Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a central role in every aspect of our lives: recommendation, navigation, healthcare, finance, engineering, gaming, and robotics, to name a few. Most of this course's website was drafted using artificial intelligence. AI is booming to life like the Internet was 25 years ago, it's the modern equivalence of high-level programming languages, the secret sauce of software enginering, the subject of close attention by research, industry, and ethics communities, and provides an exciting opportunity for students and researchers to explore the theory, practice, and impact of this technology.
